"""
Cron job scheduling system for Takyon Agent.

This module provides scheduled task execution, allowing the agent to:
- Run automated tasks on schedules (cron expressions, intervals, one-shot)
- Self-schedule reminders and follow-up tasks
- Execute tasks in isolated sessions (no prior context)

Cron jobs are executed automatically by the gateway daemon:
    takyon gateway install    # Install as a user service
    sudo takyon gateway install --system  # Linux servers: boot-time system service
    takyon gateway            # Or run in foreground

The gateway ticks the scheduler every 60 seconds. A file lock prevents
duplicate execution if multiple processes overlap.
