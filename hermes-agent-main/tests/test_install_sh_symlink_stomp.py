"""Regression for #21454: re-running install.sh on a symlinked prior install.

Older versions of ``install.sh`` created ``$command_link_dir/takyon`` as a
symlink to the pip-generated entry point at ``$TAKYON_BIN`` (i.e.
``venv/bin/takyon``). When ``setup_path()`` later switched to writing a bash
shim with ``cat > "$command_link_dir/takyon" <<EOF``, the redirect followed
the existing symlink and overwrote the pip entry point with the shim. The
shim's ``exec "$TAKYON_BIN" "$@"`` then self-recursed and ``takyon`` hung on
every invocation.

These tests pin the fix: ``setup_path()`` must remove ``$command_link_dir/takyon``
before writing through the redirect, so the shim is created as a regular file
in ``command_link_dir`` and the venv entry point is left intact.
